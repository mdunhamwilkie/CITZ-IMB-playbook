## Definition of a Modern Application
A modern application is one that exhibits five important characteristics:
- It supports multiple users through the interface of their choice
  - Web, Mobile, API (application programming interface)
- It provides an API for accessing data over [HTTP(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS){:target="_blank"} for all features that would normally be available over a graphical user interface (GUI) or the command line interface (CLI)
- Its data is available via generic formats (such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON){:target="_blank"} or XML)
- It is built on a modern stack that supports the creation of an application with an HTTP interface and an API which can consume and emit JSON data
- It conforms to the relevant elements of a [12-factor](https://12factor.net/){:target="_blank"} application
